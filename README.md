# Iris Data Set Assignment 

The Iris flower has two species, Iris-setosa and Iris-versicolor.
Go to Iris Flower Dataset | Kaggle and download the dataset.
Create a model that can predict which species it is based on its features.
Do this in a Jupyter notebook and submit it together with your dataset.

# Requirement
Anaconda
Jupytor

# Installation
## Objective

The Iris dataset consists of 50 samples for each of three species of Iris flower - Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Each sample is comprised of 4 measurements or features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Our objective was to Create a model that can predict which species it is based on its features.

# Loading the Data
Go to Iris Flower Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset Kaggle and download the dataset.
Upload it to your Jupyter notebook and read the file with this code
df = pd.read_csv("IRIS.csv")
print(df.head(4))
